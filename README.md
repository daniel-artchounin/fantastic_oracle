# ETL for the Data Warehouse of the company Fantastic

In the context of the course Data warehouse and decision support 
(NF26) taught at Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC), 
I have implemented a Data Warehouse (DW) containing relevant data 
of a fictitious company (called Fantastic) selling books. The DW 
goal was to identify the factors that affect the sales of the 
company. Two software solutions have been implemented. The solution
in the repository is the first one: implementation of an ETL ex nihilo, 
in batch mode and without handling the incremental aspect of the data 
structure. Implementation and use of the DW in Oracle Database. 

Technologies: UML, SQL and PL/SQL
